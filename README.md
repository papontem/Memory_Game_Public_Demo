# Memory_Game_Public_Demo
This is a repo for a game i made by adding some Css and Javascript.

## How To Play
When you run the html file or open the hosted page, you are prompted to type a number of color pairs of cards that you would like to start with. Currently you can go as high as 24 pairs meaning you will have 48 cards max on the webpage if you were to type 24.

Simply click or press the cards to reveal their color, and match with its pair to get closer to the end of the game.

Once you have revealed and matched the last pair, you will get an alert that the game has ended.

## ToDo:
This is a list of things i'd like to implement as i get better at software development.

1. Better animation for the revealing of cards. I want to actually see the card turn from one side to the other after its been click and when its folded back.

2. Add a timer from the moment you flip your first card that runs until you flip your last pair.

3. Add a main menu to show some localy saved information and to edit local properties of the game before it starts.
    - Show whats the users highest score
    - Keeping track of time as a choice, or show/hide time on screen.
    - Changing the choices of color pairs with a slider.
    - Change the background of the game to any img
    - Change the back side of the cards to any img
    - Change the font style of the page
    - Change the style of the time keeper
